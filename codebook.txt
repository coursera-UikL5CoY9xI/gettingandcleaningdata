The *_data.txt files all use a similar format.
Column names are enumerated in subject_labels.txt

This is a data reduction, the original codebook holds the details
for the columnar specifics.
Original codebook information:
"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"
Original dataset location:
"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata/projectfiles/UCI HAR Dataset.zip"

## subject_data.txt
# Column 1 (subject)
This contains the subject ID, a value from 1 to 30

# Column 2 (activity)
This is descriptive text indicating the activity type, levels are:
"LAYING"
"SITTING"
"STANDING"
"WALKING"
"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
"WALKING_UPSTAIRS"

Note: not every subject has participated in every activity.

# Columns 3:68
These are the columns further described in subject_labels.txt.
The extracted columns from the original data set are mean() and
std() columns.  They contain observation values for the subject:activity
tuple, as such multiple entries for each tuple occur.


## average_data.txt
Column information is as above with the following change:
There exists only 1 instance of each subject:activity tuple. The
remaining columns are the _mean_ of the rows that match that tuple
in the subject_data.txt data set.
